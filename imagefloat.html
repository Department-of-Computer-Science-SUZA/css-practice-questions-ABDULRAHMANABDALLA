    <p>Orange is a vibrant fruit known for its bright color and tangy flavor. It belongs to the citrus species and is popular worldwide for its refreshing taste and numerous health benefits. Oranges are typically round and orange in color, although some varieties can be found in different shapes and colors.

        One of the most notable aspects of oranges is their high vitamin C content. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps boost the immune system, promote healthy skin, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Oranges also contain other vitamins and minerals such as vitamin A, B vitamins, potassium, and calcium, which are essential for overall health.
        
        In addition to being nutritious, oranges are also versatile and can be enjoyed in many ways. They can be eaten fresh, juiced, or used as a flavoring in various dishes and desserts. Orange zest, the outermost layer of the peel, is often used to add a pop of flavor to recipes.
        
        Overall, oranges are not only delicious but also incredibly beneficial for health, making them a popular choice for a healthy diet.</p>
